Important: Slideshow Player works by scanning supported websites for posts, retrieving the direct links of files, then embedding them using the HTML elements generated by the player. As such:

- None of the content is redistributed outside of the browser cache. Using this software is equal to viewing the page of a submission on its original website.
- The developers are not responsible for the content on any of the supported websites. If you encounter submissions which you believe should not be there, please contact the administration of the site in cause.
- Some websites may contain NSFW material. You can leave the NSFW checkbox disabled to tell websites to serve only safe content. We are in no way responsible for what people watch nor how others choose to use this software!
- The code is optimized to network as little data as possible from websites, using the public API provided by those sites. If you believe this software is causing an unjustified amount of requests, please notify us so that we may investigate any potential bugs.
